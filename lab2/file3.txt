When I was five, I had an experience that marked me for life. 
Pathé News sent a photographer from New York to Savannah to take a picture of a chicken of mine. 
This chicken, a buff Cochin Bantam, had the distinction of being able to walk either forward or backward. 
Her fame has spread through the press and by the time she reached the at­tention of Pathé News, 
I suppose there was nowhere left for her to go—forward or backward. Shortly after that she died, as now seems fitting.
If I put this information in the beginning of an article on peacocks, it is because I am always being asked why I raise them, 
and I have no short or reasonable answer.
From that day with the Pathé man I began to collect chickens.
What had been only a mild interest became a passion, a quest. I had to have more and more chickens. 
I favored those with one green eye and one orange or with over-long necks and crooked combs. 
I wanted one with three legs or three wings but nothing in that line turned up. 
I pon­dered over the picture in Robert Ripley’s book, Believe It Or Not, of a rooster 
that had survived for thirty days without his head; but I did not have a scientific temperament . 
I could sew in a fashion and I began to make clothes for chickens. 
A gray bantam named Colonel Eggbert wore a white piqué coat with a lace collar and two buttons in the back. 
Apparently Pathé News never heard of any of these other chickens of mine; it never sent another photographer.
